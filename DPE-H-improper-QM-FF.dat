#improper data for DPE-H, fixed the missing prope dihedals in the top file from residue.itp and forcefield.itp files, deleted the impropers that we manually put for 
#the ring  to keep it flat, and added the midding dihedral from fitting the proper-dihedral fit of DPE-H, finally fixed the improper dihedral of the CAL to linker, note
#that we need to add this improper in ETH (Linker) residue since it has residue number 2 and one more and one less then gromacs and pdb2gmx will recognize it
#angles    #modifiedFF(without improper)   #QM    #modified-modifiedFF(with impropers)
